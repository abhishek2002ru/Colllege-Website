                        planes using conducting polymers. Development of medines for cancer, HIV, COVID 19 may also be
                        developed by joing the pharmaceutical industry as Research Assocites.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ph.D:</strong> Research Works for Ph.D degrees are also carried out on polymers. Research
                        works on Acrylic Polymers help to absorb water and moisture helping agriculture in desert areas
                        and in draught. Acrylic Polymers are also helping in the development of paints and coating
                        materials. Electrically Conducting Polymers are helpful in the preparation of long lasting
                        batteries, better quality of transistor, diode, solar panels and stealth technology of fighter
                        planes. Both types research works are carried out in the Gossner College, Chemistry Department.
